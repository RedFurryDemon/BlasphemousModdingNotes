## Introduction
These notes are subjective, they quite possibly *don't* cover all possible tools and options, and I take no responsibility for you accidentally fucking up your install and/or saves. I started writing them first and foremost for my own reference, given that the modding documentation for Blasphemous was practically nonexistent. Needless to say, they're still extremely incomplete.  
  
A large part of this file is written in the form of a tutorial, mainly because that makes it much easier for me to write.  
  
Notably, no prior image editing/coding experience is necessary to follow these notes (although it's certainly useful).

## In case of problems...
Okay, you weren't sure what you were doing. The game won't start or is all messed up, and no backup can help.  
  
Maybe it is The Miracle that is punishing you for trying to change game data, but hey, it's possible to fix that.

Try to [verify the integrity of game files on Steam](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335). For another source, back up your saves, nuke the whole game and reinstall it clean.
